As of 1/17/2019

This is a sample of my code/contribution for a web app where I built out a sign up form using

- React
- Redux
- material-ui
- axios

Things to note:
- I have extended material-ui's components for customized behavior.
- I created my own custom form validations so that error messages are checked for and provided in real time for each field.
- The form validation also works to enable the submit button once every required field has been validated true.
- Input fields have been customized for modularity.
